--- Improved (RAA) Model Sample Outputs ---

[Example 1]
Prompt: John went to the store.
Ground Truth: John visited the store to purchase milk. Upon arriving home, he discovered his keys were missing. Remembering he might have left them at the store, he returned to find them.
Improved Output: John went to the store to buy milk. After purchasing the milk, he returned home but realized he forgot his keys. Since he needed the keys, he went back to the store to retrieve them. (More coherent and better causal reasoning)

[Example 2]
Prompt: The cat jumped onto the table.
Ground Truth: The cat jumped onto the table, knocking over a vase. The vase shattered on the floor, making a loud noise. The cat immediately ran and hid under the bed.
Improved Output: The cat jumped onto the table, causing the vase to fall and shatter. Startled by the noise, the cat quickly fled and hid under the bed. (Detailed and logically consistent)
