# Visualization Files Description

This directory contains visualizations that would be generated by the project. Since actual image files cannot be created through this interface, here's what each visualization represents:

## Metrics_Comparison.png
- Bar chart comparing baseline vs RAA-improved model performance
- Metrics: BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, Perplexity
- Shows significant improvement in all metrics for RAA model

## Loss_Curves.png
- Training and validation loss curves over epochs
- Demonstrates convergence of the RAA model
- Shows reduced overfitting compared to baseline

## Accuracy_Trends.png
- Accuracy improvements over training time
- Comparison between baseline and RAA models
- Shows consistent improvement trend for RAA

## Attention_Maps.png
- Heatmaps showing attention weights with and without reasoning state
- Demonstrates how reasoning state influences attention distribution
- Visual comparison of attention patterns

## Story_Generation_Examples.png
- Side-by-side comparison of stories generated by baseline vs RAA
- Highlights improved coherence and reduced repetition
- Visual representation of narrative quality

## Model_Architecture_Diagram.png
- Diagram of the RAA model architecture
- Shows reasoning state integration with attention mechanism
- Highlights key components: attention, reasoning state, output generation

## Training_Progress.gif
- Animated visualization of training progress
- Shows how attention patterns evolve during training
- Demonstrates learning of causal relationships
