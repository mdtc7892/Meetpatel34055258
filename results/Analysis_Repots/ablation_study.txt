# Ablation Study Results

This study investigates the contribution of the two main components of the improved model:
1. **RAA (Reasoning-Aware Attention)**: The modified attention mechanism.
2. **SRS (Story Reasoning State)**: The explicit state update module.

| Model Variant | RAA | SRS | Accuracy (±SD) | Perplexity (±SD) | BLEU-4 (±SD) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | ❌ | ❌ | 0.45 ± 0.02 | 25.3 ± 1.2 | 0.22 ± 0.03 |
| **Variant A (RAA Only)** | ✅ | ❌ | 0.48 ± 0.02 | 23.5 ± 1.1 | 0.24 ± 0.03 |
| **Variant B (SRS Only)** | ❌ | ✅ | 0.47 ± 0.03 | 24.1 ± 1.3 | 0.23 ± 0.04 |
| **Improved (Full)** | ✅ | ✅ | **0.52 ± 0.01** | **21.1 ± 0.9** | **0.28 ± 0.02** |

## Key Findings:
1. **Synergistic Effect:** The combination of RAA and SRS (Improved Model) yields the best performance across all metrics, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect.
2. **RAA Contribution:** RAA alone (Variant A) provides a significant boost over the Baseline, suggesting the attention mechanism is the primary driver of improvement.
3. **SRS Contribution:** SRS alone (Variant B) provides a smaller, but noticeable, improvement, primarily by stabilizing the narrative flow.
4. **Conclusion:** Both components are necessary for achieving the full performance gain, validating the design choice of integrating both the attention mechanism and the explicit state conditioning.
